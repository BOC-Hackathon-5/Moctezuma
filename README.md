### Moctezuma
The current process of buying real estate often takes more than two months due to administrative, legal, and financial complexities.
**Moctezuma** addresses this by integrating with financial institutions to tokenize real estate assets,
leveraging the upcoming _Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA)_ regulation in Cyprus (2024â€“2026).
In addition, we are integrating the digital euro to facilitate seamless transactions.
This solution reduces the time to purchase real estate from two months to under one day, allowing banks to offer a faster,
more efficient experience while taking full advantage of the new regulatory and financial framework.
